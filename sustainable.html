        What is Fast Fashion?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Fast fashion is clothing that is produced in masses to keep up with the
        ever-changing trends. The goal of fast fashion is just what the name
        suggests– to produce it fast. Because it is made quickly in large
        quantities, the clothing is cheap. However, cheap and mass-produced
        clothing does not have the best quality, hence lacking sustainability.

        The Dark Side of Fast Fashion
      </p>

      <p>
        Although fast fashion may sound like an ideal way to purchase clothing,
        it has many downfalls. It is harmful both environmentally and ethically.
        Reasons to re-think fast fashion are-

        Environmentally Disastrous:
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion, fast fashion is
        responsible for 2-8% of the entire world’s carbon emissions. The biggest
        issue with fast fashion is waste. Fast fashion keeps up with
        ever-changing trends, leading to productions of poor quality clothing
        that is not meant to last. As a result, consumers only wear a clothing
        item a few times before throwing it away, contributing to the “waste”.
        Fast fashion is also responsible for water wastage at alarmingly high
        levels.

        The Exploitation of Workers :
      </p>
      <p>
        On the ethical side, factory workers for fast fashion companies are
        often subjected to less than liveable wages. Because the cost of the
        clothing is so cheap to sell, workers often make a fraction of that
        price, leading to many of them living below the poverty line. In some
        cases around the world, major fast-fashion corporations have been
        accused of providing inhumane work environments for their employees.
        These big companies exploit their workers. Inhumane practices like child
        labour is also practiced by some fast fashion brands.

        Fast Fashion Can Possibly Cost You More Than “Real” Clothing:
      </p>

      <p>
        Sure, buying fast fashion can be extremely affordable, but it’s
        important to think about the quality of the clothing that is being
        purchased. When a consumer purchases a shirt for Rs.70, it may not hold
        up for long, the customer throws it away and buys the same shirt again
        .The same scenario repeats itself and the customer ends up buying a
        RS.250 high-quality shirt which is more than likely to last longer, and
        reduces the waste to a minimum.

        Sustainable Fashion: A Response to Fast Fashion
      </h2>
      <p>
        Sustainable fashion is clothing, shoes, and accessories that are
        manufactured, marketed and used as sustainably as possible, taking into
        account both environmental and ethical aspects. Sustainable fashion is
        clothing that is produced with a focus on being environmentally
        friendly. Many sustainable fashion brands also focus on being ethical as
        well, as the two go hand in hand.

        Environmental Benefits of Sustainable Fashion
      </p>
      <p>
        The main difference in fast vs. sustainable fashion is the amount of
        waste that each one produces. Sustainable fashion decreases waste by
        making clothing that is significantly of better quality. Lesser waste
        leads to both less water pollution and fewer carbon emissions during
        production. Some sustainable companies also work to reduce waste during
        production and even collect data to determine better ways to recycle and
        reuse materials.

        Ethical Benefits of Sustainable Fashion
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike fast fashion, sustainable fashion focuses more on ethics as well
        as the environment. They promote healthier work environments by taking
        extra measures to ensure safety and provide liveable wages to their
        workers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Major sustainable companies have verified high standards in both their
        social and economic performance. This is a major step to reducing
        inequality and poverty rates by providing opportunities through their
        business. How wholesome is that!

        Significant ethical benefits-
      </p>
      <p>
        • Providing humane working conditions in their communities which also
        includes developing areas of India.
      </p>
      <p>
        • Paying liveable wages to their factory workers to reduce poverty rates
        and eliminate child labour.
      </p>
      <p>
        • Give back to the community by working for and supporting the local
        area.
      </p>
      <p>
        • Partner with companies that share similar values to their own to
        support the growth of ‘ethical companies’ as whole.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>How Can I Support Ethical Companies?</p>
      <h3>SUPPORT SMALL-SUPPORT ETHICAL-SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        Simple. Support ethical companies by consuming what they have to offer.
        By purchasing their products or services, you are allowing that company
        to stay in business, giving value to their hard work and determination
        and ultimately doing good for your community.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Support small businesses , buy from local sellers and contribute towards
        a sustainable future.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p>
        Supporting ethical companies helps encourage brands to become
        lifestyles. Beyond just fashion, they attempt to educate the public on
        important issues in their community and around the world. Promote small
        businesses, non-profit organizations that share their ethical beliefs.
        Purchasing from an ethical company can help bring its popularity above
        fast fashion in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sustainable fashion is the future! If we want our future generations to
        live in a healthy and ethical climate , we have to work towards a
        sustainable future ,to which sustainable fashion is a huge step.
